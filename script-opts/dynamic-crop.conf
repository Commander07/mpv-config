# This script uses the lavfi cropdetect filter to automatically insert a crop filter with appropriate parameters
#     for the currently playing video, the script run continuously by default (mode 4).

# To use this script, "hwdec=no" (mpv default/recommended) or any "-copy" variant like "hwdec=auto-copy" is required,
#     consider editing "mpv.conf" to an appropriate value.

# The workflow is as follows: We observe ffmpeg log to collect metadata and process it.
#     Collected metadata are stored sequentially in s.buffer, then process to check and
#     store trusted values to speed up future change for the current video.
#     It will automatically crop the video as soon as a change is validated.
# The default options can be overridden by adding a line into "mpv.conf" with:
#     script-opts-append=<script_name>-<parameter>=<value>
#     script-opts-append=dynamic_crop-mode=0
#     script-opts-append=dynamic_crop-ratios=2.4 2.39 2 4/3 (quotes aren't needed like below)
# Extended descriptions for some parameters (For default values, see <options>):
# mode: [0-4] 0 disable, 1 on-demand, 2 one-shot, 3 dynamic-manual, 4 dynamic-auto
#     Mode 1 and 3 requires using the shortcut to start, 2 and 4 have an automatic start.
# Shortcut "C" (shift+c) to control the script.
# Cycle between ENABLE / DISABLE_WITH_CROP / DISABLE
# prevent_change_mode: [0-3] 0 disable 1 keep-largest, 2 keep-lowest, 3 keep-latest
#     The prevent_change_timer is trigger after a change.
# fix_windowed_behavior: [0-3] Avoid the default behavior that resizes the window to the source size
#     when the crop filter changes in windowed/maximized mode by adjusting geometry.
# limit_timer: Only used if the cropdetect filter doesn't handle limit changes with a command (patch 01/2023).
#     Extend the time between each limit change to reduce the impact on performance caused by re-initializing the
#     full filter.
# read_ahead_mode: Linked to the associated timer and tells how much time in advance to collect the metadata.
#     This feature is useful for videos with multiple aspect ratio changes for "fast_change_timer".
#     Note: because this function is in sync with the playback, a delay equivalent to the timer used is
#     added/reset every time you seek before you get a reaction, so setting 1 is recommanded.
#     Required at least https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/69c060bea21d3b4ce63b5fff40d37e98c70ab88f
#     and optionally https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/pull/11182, until mpv patch is being merged to master,
#     considered this feature experimental because of the errors generated in logs/console by vf-command and
#     the filter used to sync the filter chain (psnr).
# read_ahead_sync: Compensates for the delay when applying the crop filter and the visible result.
#     Must be adjusted to your tastes and each MPV client depending on their reaction time.
#     Note: Perfect adjustment is not really possible but generally <= 1 frame, sometimes more in
#     dark/ambiguous scenes.
# segmentation: e.g. 0.5 for 50% - Extra time to allow new metadata to be segmented instead of being continuous.
#     This is used with ratio_timer, offset_timer and fallback_timer.
#     e.g. ratio_timer is validated with 5 sec accumulated over 7.5 sec elapsed.
